This bot is currently undergoing a complete rewrite to reflect the changes made in the discord.py write.
 
How To Use:
First, invite the bot to your server with this link:

https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[BOT_CLIENT_ID]&scope=bot
Replace [BOT_CLIENT_ID] with your bot's own client ID

Then, run bot.py with any of these commands


  -h, --help            show help message and exit

  -r [BOT_TOKEN], --run [BOT_TOKEN]
                        Run a new bot

  -t [OWNER_ID], --test [OWNER_ID]
                        (Requires -r first) Run a new bot with a specific user ID as the "Owner". Note: only the owner can use the bot commands

  -v, --version_info    Get discord version info
